# The process
Story of this project starts way back in 9th grade. I was a begginer(i mean i still am, but I am a more expirienced beginner) i did not know much about programming but i have already written my chare of console applications and decsded that it is time to level up.
As my language of choice a picked python scince i was already familiar with it. After it was time to choose what technologie i would use for graphics and ptQt grabed my attention speciffically beacause of designer. 
At the time i only knew python. After 9th grade i went to collegeand first year was basically school, but on second year I was introduced to c++. I have heard of it before but decided to stik to what i knew. By 3rd year i kind of abbandonet this project.
During 3rd year i took OOP and as a final project i had to make something using qt/c++ and i saw a chance to finally complete this project.

# How do i run this?
the answer is simple enought if you alredy use linux, if not you will need to eather install on a virtual machine or use docker or you can find another way around your os.
All you have to do is **download .flatpak** file from the repo and then install it by running  
```flatpak install readingDiary.flatpak```  
and then  
```flatpak run org.flatpak.readingDiary```

# Video demonstration
is gonna be here soon
